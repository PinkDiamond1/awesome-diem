- [The Official Libra White Paper - Web Version](https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper), [PDF Download (~600k, 12 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra.pdf) 

> Libra's mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.
>
> This document outlines our plans for a new decentralized blockchain, a low-volatility cryptocurrency, 
> and a smart contract platform that together aim to create a new opportunity for responsible financial services innovation.

## Currency / Money

Libra is a stablecoin backed by a basket of (four?) currencies (USD, EURO, GBP, YEN), and US Treasury securities in an attempt to avoid volatility (and speculation). 
Facebook has announced that each of the (100?) partners will stake an initial US$10 million, so Libra is backed by US$1 billion of solid currency, on the day it opens.

**Libra Rerseve**

- The Official Libra Reserve White Paper, [PDF Download (~40k, 4 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra-reserve.pdf)

> Q: What are the actual assets that will be backing each Libra coin? A: The actual assets will be
> a collection of low-volatility assets, including bank deposits and government securities in currencies
> from stable and reputable central banks. As the value of Libra will be effectively linked to a basket
of fiat currencies, from the point of view of any specific currency, there will be fluctuations in the
value of Libra. The makeup of the reserve is designed to mitigate the likelihood and severity of these
fluctuations, particularly in the negative direction (i.e., even in economic crises). To that end, the
above basket has been structured with capital preservation and liquidity in mind. On the capital
preservation point, the association will only invest in debt from stable governments with low default
probability that are unlikely to experience high inflation. In addition, the reserve has been diversified
by selecting multiple governments, rather than just one, to further reduce the potential impact of such
events. In terms of liquidity, the association plans to rely on short-dated securities issued by these
governments, that are all traded in liquid markets that regularly accommodate daily trading volume
in the tens or even hundreds of billions. This allows the size of the reserve to be easily adjusted as
the number of Libra in circulation expands or contracts.

### Blockchain / Protocol

- [The Official Libra Blockchain / Protocol White Paper - Web Version](https://developers.libra.org/docs/the-libra-blockchain-paper), [PDF Download (~400k, 29 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra-blockchain.pdf) 

> **Abstract**: The Libra Blockchain is a decentralized, programmable database designed to support a
> low-volatility cryptocurrency that will have the ability to serve as an efficient medium of exchange for
> billions of people around the world. We present a proposal for the Libra protocol, which implements
> the Libra Blockchain and aims to create a financial infrastructure that can foster innovation, lower
> barriers to entry, and improve access to financial services. To validate the design of the Libra protocol,
> we have built an open-source prototype implementation - Libra Core - in anticipation of a global
> collaborative effort to advance this new ecosystem.
>
> The Libra protocol allows a set of replicas - referred to as validators - from different authorities
> to jointly maintain a database of programmable resources. These resources are owned by different
> user accounts authenticated by public key cryptography and adhere to custom rules specified by the
> developers of these resources. Validators process transactions and interact with each other to reach
> consensus on the state of the database. Transactions are based on predefined and, in future versions,
> user-defined smart contracts in a new programming language called Move.
>
> We use Move to define the core mechanisms of the blockchain, such as the currency and validator
> membership. These core mechanisms enable the creation of a unique governance mechanism that
> builds on the stability and reputation of existing institutions in the early days but transitions to a
> fully open system over time.

> We believe that for the Libra network to achieve its full potential, it needs to be permissionless.
> As a result, one of the association's directives will be to work with the community to research and implement
> this transition, which will begin within five years of the public launch of the Libra Blockchain and ecosystem.



### Move Programming Language

_The (Secure) Contract-Oriented Programming Language for Digital (Blockchain) Resources / Assets_

- [The Official Move: A Language With Programmable Resources White Paper - Web Version](https://developers.libra.org/docs/move-paper), [PDF Download (~200k, 26 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra-move.pdf) 

> **Abstract:** We present Move, a safe and flexible programming language for the Libra Blockchain.
> Move is an executable bytecode language used to implement custom transactions and smart contracts.
> The key feature of Move is the ability to define custom resource types with semantics inspired by linear
> logic: a resource can never be copied or implicitly discarded, only moved between program storage
> locations. These safety guarantees are enforced statically by Move's type system. Despite these
> special protections, resources are ordinary program values - they can be stored in data structures,
> passed as arguments to procedures, and so on. First-class resources are a very general concept that
> programmers can use not only to implement safe digital assets but also to write correct business
> logic for wrapping assets and enforcing access control policies. The safety and expressivity of Move
> have enabled us to implement significant parts of the Libra protocol in Move, including Libra coin,
> transaction processing, and validator management.


Planned to be a statically-typed programming language derived from Rust, compiled to bytecode.
Example of a peer-to-peer transaction script:

```
// Simple peer-peer payment example.

// Use LibraAccount module published on the blockchain at account address
// 0x0...0 (with 64 zeroes). 0x0 is shorthand that the IR pads out to
// 256 bits (64 digits) by adding leading zeroes.
import 0x0.LibraAccount;
import 0x0.LibraCoin;
main(payee: address, amount: u64) {
  // The bytecode (and consequently, the IR) has typed locals.  The scope of
  // each local is the entire procedure. All local variable declarations must
  // be at the beginning of the procedure. Declaration and initialization of
  // variables are separate operations, but the bytecode verifier will prevent
  // any attempt to use an uninitialized variable.
  let coin: R#LibraCoin.T;
  // The R# part of the type above is one of two *kind annotation* R# and V#
  // (shorthand for "Resource" and "unrestricted Value"). These annotations
  // must match the kind of the type declaration (e.g., does the LibraCoin
  // module declare `resource T` or `struct T`?).

  // Acquire a LibraCoin.T resource with value `amount` from the sender's
  // account.  This will fail if the sender's balance is less than `amount`.
  coin = LibraAccount.withdraw_from_sender(move(amount));
  // Move the LibraCoin.T resource into the account of `payee`. If there is no
  // account at the address `payee`, this step will fail
  LibraAccount.deposit(move(payee), move(coin));

  // Every procedure must end in a `return`. The IR compiler is very literal:
  // it directly translates the source it is given. It will not do fancy
  // things like inserting missing `return`s.
  return;
}
```

## Consensus with Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

_Inside Libra Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and the HotStuff Protocol - The Truth Machine with State Replication_ 


- [The Official Libra Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): State Machine Replication in the Blockchain White Paper - Web Version](https://developers.libra.org/docs/state-machine-replication-paper), [PDF Download (~300k, 41 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/libra-consensus.pdf) 

> **Abstract**: This report presents LibraBFT, a robust and efficient state machine replication system designed for the Libra Blockchain.
> LibraBFT is based on HotStuff, a recent protocol that leverages several decades of scientific advances in Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)
> and achieves the strong scalability and security properties required by internet settings. LibraBFT further refines the HotStuff
> protocol to introduce explicit liveness mechanisms and provides a concrete latency analysis. To drive the integration with the Libra
> Blockchain, this document provides specifications extracted from a fully-functional simulator. These specifications include state
> replication interfaces and a communication framework for data transfer and state synchronization among participants. 
> Finally, this report provides a formal safety proof that induces criteria to detect misbehavior of BFT nodes, 
> coupled with a simple reward and punishment mechanism.

**HotStuff**

- [HotStuff: Three-chain Rules!](https://dahliamalkhi.wordpress.com/2018/10/24/hotstuff-three-chain-rules/) by Dahlia Malkhi, October 24, 2018 - Most protocols contain quadratic voting steps. When Byzantine consensus protocols were originally conceived, a typical target system size was n=4 or n=7, tolerating one or two faults. But scaling Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to n=2000 means that even on a good day, when communication is timely and a handful of failures occurs, quadratic steps require 4,000,000 messages. A cascade of failures might bring the communication complexity to whopping 8,000,000,000 (!) transmissions for a single consensus decision...
- [HotStuff: Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Consensus with Linearity and Responsiveness Whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069),  [PDF Download (~800k, 10 Pages)](https://github.com/openblockchains/blockchain-whitepapers/raw/master/hotstuff.pdf) by Maofan Yin, Dahlia Malkhi, Michael K. Reiter, Guy Golan Gueta, Ittai Abraham -  a leader-based Byzantine fault-tolerant replication protocol for the partially synchronous model. Once network communication becomes synchronous, HotStuff enables a correct leader to drive the protocol to consensus at the pace of actual (vs. maximum) network delay - a property called responsiveness - and with communication complexity that is linear in the number of replicas. To our knowledge, HotStuff is the first partially synchronous BFT replication protocol exhibiting these combined properties. Its simplicity enables it to be further pipelined and simplified into a practical, concise protocol for building large-scale replication services.
